Hi Kalpesh, Rohit,

As we previously discussed, I would like to request approval to work from home from October 6th through October 24th due to my upcoming engagement on October 12th.

Additionally, I would like to request leave for the following dates:
* October 10th (Friday)
* October 23rd (Wednesday)
* October 24th (Thursday)

I will ensure all my responsibilities are managed effectively during this time and will remain accessible for any urgent matters.

Please let me know  if you need any further detail. I appreciate your understanding and support.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Parimala
