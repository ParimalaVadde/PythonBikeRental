Perfect 👍 then it should be clearly stated in the email so they know the overwrite is happening *because of their current logic*.

Here’s the refined version for you to send:

**Subject:** File Overwrite Issue in S3 Uploads

Hi Team,

We noticed an issue with the source file uploads to your S3 bucket. As per your current logic, any uploaded file is named **`analysis_<datetime>`**. When two files are uploaded at the same time, the generated filenames differ only by milliseconds, causing one file to be overwritten.

For example, in yesterday’s upload, only the *OrvaDirect* file was present while the *Total Energies* file was overwritten. As a result, only one file was processed.

Requesting you to kindly look into this and fix the issue — either by introducing a unique naming convention or by ensuring a time gap (at least 2–5 minutes) between uploads.

Thanks,
\[Your Name]

Want me to make this **more formal (like escalation to management)** or keep it **neutral and collaborative**?
