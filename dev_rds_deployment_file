These errors indicate you need to manually delete resources in a specific order before you can successfully delete the workspace. The errors show that various AWS resources have dependency relationships that need to be resolved first.

Let me break down what needs to be deleted and in what order:

1. **First - Service Discovery Services:**
   - Error: `ResourceInUse: Namespace has associated services`
   - You need to first delete all services in the Service Discovery namespace before the namespace itself can be deleted

2. **Second - App Mesh Virtual Services:**
   - Error: `Mesh has active VirtualServices`
   - You need to delete all virtual services in the App Mesh before you can delete the mesh itself

3. **Third - ECS Services and Tasks:**
   - Error: `The specified capacity provider is in use`
   - Delete all ECS services and tasks that are using the capacity provider

4. **Fourth - Security Group Dependencies:**
   - Error: `DependencyViolation: resource sg-0119ee9d5d1402c25 has a dependent object`
   - Find and delete all resources that are using this security group

5. **Fifth - CloudFormation Stack:**
   - Error: `failed to delete CloudFormation stack`
   - You may need to manually delete this stack in the AWS Console

Here's a step-by-step manual cleanup process you can follow:

1. **Service Discovery:**
   ```bash
   # List services in the namespace
   aws servicediscovery list-services --filters "Name=NAMESPACE_ID,Values=ns-beltbaz3jjvaoqlx"
   
   # Delete each service (replace SERVICE_ID with actual IDs)
   aws servicediscovery delete-service --id SERVICE_ID
   ```

2. **App Mesh:**
   ```bash
   # List virtual services in the mesh
   aws appmesh list-virtual-services --mesh-name xbsd-api-pull-ecs
   
   # Delete each virtual service
   aws appmesh delete-virtual-service --mesh-name xbsd-api-pull-ecs --virtual-service-name NAME
   
   # You may also need to delete virtual routers and nodes
   aws appmesh list-virtual-routers --mesh-name xbsd-api-pull-ecs
   aws appmesh list-virtual-nodes --mesh-name xbsd-api-pull-ecs
   ```

3. **ECS Cluster:**
   ```bash
   # List services in the cluster
   aws ecs list-services --cluster xbsd-api-pull-ecs
   
   # Delete each service (update desired count to 0 first)
   aws ecs update-service --cluster xbsd-api-pull-ecs --service SERVICE_NAME --desired-count 0
   aws ecs delete-service --cluster xbsd-api-pull-ecs --service SERVICE_NAME
   
   # Detach capacity providers
   aws ecs put-cluster-capacity-providers --cluster xbsd-api-pull-ecs --capacity-providers [] --default-capacity-provider-strategy []
   ```

4. **Security Group:**
   ```bash
   # Find attached resources
   aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --filters Name=group-id,Values=sg-0119ee9d5d1402c25
   
   # For each network interface, detach or delete it
   aws ec2 delete-network-interface --network-interface-id INTERFACE_ID
   ```

5. **CloudFormation:**
   - Use the AWS console to access CloudFormation
   - Find stack "ecs-capacity-provider-reconciler-xbsd-api-pull-ecs"
   - Try manual deletion, or retain specific resources if needed

After manually removing these dependencies, try the workspace deletion process again. If you still encounter issues, you might need to work through each resource error one by one.

Would you like me to help with specific AWS commands for any of these steps?
