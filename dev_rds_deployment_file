### Subtask 1 Closing Comments:

All identified data inconsistencies in the PDF pipeline have been addressed successfully. The related identifier lookup now correctly sources from the client relationship table, the credit rating dates are accurately populated from the source file, and the case-insensitive handling of `ind_card_match` ensures proper association name assignment. These fixes have been tested and validated.

### Subtask 2 Closing Comments:

The analysis for implementing retry logic on landing job failures is complete. A clear approach for moving failed files to a separate S3 location has been defined, ensuring failed files are isolated for reprocessing without data duplication. Development of this retry mechanism will be scheduled for the upcoming sprint.
