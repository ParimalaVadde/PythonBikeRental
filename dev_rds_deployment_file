## ðŸŸ¨ **Sub-Task 1: DEV â€“ client\_ecid UI Visibility Issue**

### âœ… **Corrected Description:**

In the staging environment, `client_ecid` was being stored as a relationship field, preventing it from being displayed in the UI. This needed correction to ensure visibility.

### âœ… **Closing Comment:**

Mapping of `client_ecid` has been corrected. It is now stored in a UI-visible format and displays correctly in the staging environment. Issue resolved.

## ðŸŸ¨ **Sub-Task 2: UAT â€“ Multiple ECIDs per Business Entity**

### âœ… **Corrected Description:**

A single `business_entity` was incorrectly linked to multiple `ecid` values in staging, violating expected 1:1 mapping rules.

### âœ… **Closing Comment:**

Data transformation logic has been updated to enforce a one-to-one mapping between `business_entity` and `ecid`. Existing staging data corrected. Issue resolved.

## ðŸŸ¨ **Sub-Task 3: UAT â€“ Multiple Tax IDs per Business Entity**

### âœ… **Corrected Description:**

Some `business_entity` records in staging were associated with multiple `taxid` values, which is inconsistent with business rules.
