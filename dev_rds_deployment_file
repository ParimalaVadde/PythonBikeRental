**Subject:** Missing File in Yesterday’s Upload

Hi Robbie,

In yesterday’s upload, two files (*total\_energies* and *orvadirect*) were uploaded at the same time by Andy. However, we see only *orvadirect* present in the PFD S3 bucket, so only that file got processed.

Could you please look into this issue?

Thanks,
\[Your Name]

Do you want me to also **add a note about the `analysis_<datetime>` logic** in this short version, or keep it strictly incident-focused?
