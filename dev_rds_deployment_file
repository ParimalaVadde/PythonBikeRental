- **Cluster Deletion Updates:**  
  9 cluster deletion FARM breaks have been successfully completed.  
  The ones marked as blockers have dependencies on the AWS team for cluster deletion. For details, please refer to the [Excel link in Teams]. These will be addressed in the next sprint.

- **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL SaaS (15.3) and Lightswitch Job Version Upgrade:**  
  There are a total of 5 FARM breaks related to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL SaaS (15.3) and the **lightswitch-job** module version 2.1.0. These issues are tied to the version upgrade, but we are facing difficulties with the RDS proxy component. A request will be raised with the EAC team to resolve the issue, and it will be taken up in the next sprint.
