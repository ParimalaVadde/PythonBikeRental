Yes, you can upgrade the VPC endpoint module versions via CLI. From the commands you've provided, I can see you've already logged into the proper AWS account using PCL AWS login and configured TFL.

Let me outline a step-by-step approach to upgrade the VPC endpoint module versions via the CLI:

1. First, make sure you're in the correct workspace:
   - I see you've configured for workspace "xbsd-api-pull-ecs-terraform-ecs-use1"
   - However, we need to ensure this is a workspace with VPC endpoints that need updating

2. Before making changes, let's examine the current state:
   ```bash
   $ tfl state list | grep vpc-endpoint
   ```
   This will show if you have any VPC endpoints in this workspace.

3. Now let's check the existing Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   $ tfl show
   ```
   Or specifically look at the files:
   ```bash
   $ cat *.tf | grep -A 10 "module.*vpc-endpoint"
   ```

4. Once you've identified the VPC endpoint module blocks, you'll need to update them. You can use a text editor or use a command like sed to update the version:
   ```bash
   $ sed -i 's/version = "[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+"/version = "7.0.0"/g' *.tf
   ```
   This will find all version strings in the module blocks and update them to "7.0.0".

5. Verify your changes:
   ```bash
   $ cat *.tf | grep -A 10 "module.*vpc-endpoint"
   ```

6. Now run a plan to see what will change:
   ```bash
   $ tfl plan
   ```

7. If the plan looks good, apply the changes:
   ```bash
   $ tfl apply
   ```

8. After the apply completes, verify in the AWS console that the MODULE_VERSION tag has been updated to 7.0.0.

Based on the data you provided, you should repeat this process for each workspace that has VPC endpoints needing updates. 

For example, to upgrade the RDS endpoint we discussed earlier, you would need to:
```bash
$ tfl configure
Address> https://tfe.jpmchase.net
Org> 111597-114116-DEV
Project> [Default Project if applicable]
Workspace> v812871-vpc-endpoint
TF Version> 1.0.8-20230519-JPMC
Region> us-east-1
```

Then follow steps 2-8 above for that workspace.

To be systematic, you might want to:
1. Create a list of all workspaces from your CSV
2. Write a script that iterates through each workspace, updates the version, and applies the changes
3. Track your progress to ensure all endpoints are updated before the May 15, 2025 deadline

Would you like help with creating such a script to automate this process across multiple workspaces?
