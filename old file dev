**Subject**: RDSProxy Module Error in Modulepack 0.14.4 - Cross-Region Lookup Failure

**Description**:

We are experiencing an issue while upgrading our RDSProxy module from modulepack version 0.13.0 to 0.14.4. The deployment is failing with a cross-region lookup error despite our attempts to disable global configuration.

**Error Details**:
- Error message: "core-Vpc01-Id was not found in CloudFormation Exports for region us-west-2"
- Error occurs in data.tf line 25 (data "aws_cloudformation_export" "vpc_id_secondary")
- Deployment ID: [Include your deployment ID if available]

**Steps Taken**:
1. Added global_config with enabled: false
2. Tried setting secondary_region to both empty string and primary region ("us-east-1")
3. Included all required fields in global_config

**Deployment File**:
Our deployment file includes RDSProxy component with:
```yaml
global_config:
  enabled: false
  secondary_region: "us-east-1"
  secondary_vpc_subnet_names: []
  primary_secrets_vpc_endpoint_dns_names: []
  secondary_secrets_vpc_endpoint_dns_names: []
```

**Impact**:
This issue is blocking our upgrade to modulepack 0.14.4, which we need for [add your business reason].

**Request**:
Please advise on the correct configuration for disabling global functionality in RDSProxy module version 0.14.4, or provide a workaround to prevent the cross-region lookup from occurring.
