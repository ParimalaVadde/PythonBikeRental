Why was this Finding raised?

The Public Cloud TLM process detected that Application <111597> has provisioned asset(s) utilizing Terraform Module <ecs-utils> <0.5.0>, which is in Prohibited lifecycle status, in the Atlas AWS Account <992382575964>. This indicates a violation of the firm's control objective regarding the use of technology products in a product lifecycle status that is not approved for use.

What is the impact of this Finding?

The use of a Terraform Module in Prohibited lifecycle status can leave the firm vulnerable to long recovery times from system failures and cyber-attacks if vendor support is no longer available. Additionally, it may lead to information loss if not disposed of securely and could result in unnecessary expenses if the asset is not purchased through approved vendors.
