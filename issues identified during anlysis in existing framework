Given your scope, **two well-scoped sub-tasks** are sufficient and clearer for execution tracking. Here's how you can split them:

---

### **Sub-Task 1: Ingest New PFD Source File into SDS Pipeline**

**Description:**
Load the newly shared PFD file into the SDS staging layer. Validate structure, handle format changes, and ensure compatibility with existing ingestion logic.

---

### **Sub-Task 2: Apply DDL Changes & Integrate New PFD Fields**

**Description:**
Implement necessary schema changes and update mappings to support the new fields. Ensure fields are reflected correctly in downstream transformations and data sinks.
