## Sub-Task 1: Integrate New PFD Fields into Data Pipeline

**Analysis Complete - 6 New Field Mappings Identified:**

1. **task_id** → analysis_task_id: New column addition to business_entity_spend_analysis table
2. **sds_upload_id** → analysis_external_reference_id: Column rename from user_request_id  
3. **client_name** → stg_payor_business_entity_id: Updated mapping source column
4. **supplier_ecid** → business_entity_identifiers: New identifier_type required in types table
5. **ind_decline/stp_partnershiplist** → business_entity_characteristics: New characteristic_types required
6. **Financial metrics (6 fields)** → business_entity_receivables_attribute: New attribute_types for throughput_usd, avg_spread, avg_payment_terms, rate_proposed, rate_offered, esg_discount

**Implementation deferred to next sprint due to file discrepancies requiring source validation.**

## Sub-Task 2: Fix Data Format Issues in Staging Glue Job

**Status: Partially Complete**

✅ **Fixed:** registered_agents processing - maintains semicolon-separated format in characteristics table  
⚠️ **Pending:** product_segmentation - currently string type, awaiting source team confirmation on data type for proper handling
receivables_attribute currently contains only single values (not semicolon-separated). No changes applied, as the source file doesn't provide multi-value data yet. Will revisit if source format changes.
**Note:** Pivoting approach used instead of exploding to maintain semicolon-separated format in receivables_attribute table.

## Sub-Task 3: Fix Entity Relationship Handling

**Status: Complete - All Issues Resolved**

✅ **Fixed:** vendor_contact_name mapping to relationship table contact names  
✅ **Fixed:** contact_id reference handling in relationship table  
✅ **Fixed:** start/end date format mapping in spend_analysis  
✅ **Fixed:** duplicate records elimination in identifiers table - implemented logic to prevent same identifier mapping to both business_entity and relationship sources

**Validation report confirms all relationship integrity issues resolved.**



Analysis completed for new PFD fields. Existing data load issues in the SDS pipeline have been fixed. Noted discrepancies in the latest shared file — remaining changes to be implemented in the next sprint.
