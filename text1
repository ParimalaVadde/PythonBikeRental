*******************************************************************************************

1)
SELECT business_entity_name,* FROM sds_staging.business_entity_details


2)
SELECT
    d.business_entity_name,
    b.*
FROM 
    sds_staging.business_entity_card_association b
JOIN 
    sds_staging.business_entity_details d 
    ON b.stg_business_entity_id = d.stg_business_entity_id
	
	
	
there are 126 distinct records in sds_staging.business_entity_details. (it has 'jpmc' , 'Coca Cola' as 2 of business_entity_name among 126)

but when i run below query i m getting only 125 records
SELECT
    d.business_entity_name,
    b.*
FROM 
    sds_staging.business_entity_card_association b
JOIN 
    sds_staging.business_entity_details d 
    ON b.stg_business_entity_id = d.stg_business_entity_id
	
	
also when i run below query i m getting only 1 record i.e for 'HALO'

SELECT
    d.business_entity_name,
    b.*
FROM 
    sds_staging.business_entity_card_association b
JOIN 
    sds_staging.business_entity_details d 
    ON b.stg_business_entity_id = d.stg_business_entity_id
where d.business_entity_name in ('jpmc','Coca Cola','HALO')

see my concern over here is, totally there are 126 records but it has 125 records but these 'jpmc','Coca Cola' are missing. it should be 124 . how come it has 125
i want to identify which business_entity_name in business_entity_card_association is missing from sds_staging.business_entity_details

like already i know it doesn't have records for 'jpmc','Coca Cola'. then it should have 124 records. how come it has 125 records
