Hi Rohit,

I’m happy to share that I’m getting married on 5th and 6th March 2026. In this regard, I would like to request leave from 2nd March 2026 to 13th March 2026.

I will ensure that all my responsibilities are managed in advance and that a proper handover of pending work is completed before I proceed on leave.

Kindly let me know if you need any additional information from my side.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
