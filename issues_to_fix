fix the identified issue's in staging glue job from the new source files uploaded 

optimize the code for database operations 
*******************************************

Sure! Here are two tasks with single-line titles and brief descriptions:

---

**Task 1: Implement Duplicate Prevention in Spend Table**
Develop logic to prevent duplicate records in the Spend table when the same data file is uploaded multiple times.

**Task 2: Handle Partial Failures During Data Load**
Ensure the pipeline processes only new records after a partial failure, avoiding duplicate inserts in the Spend table.

---

Need them more detailed or formal?


**********************************

Fix identified issues in the staging Glue job related to new source file uploads.

Optimize code performance for database operations to improve efficiency.

*******************************************

As part of performance improvement, we have to make sure that a single transaction completes within 15 mins as we have IAM authentication. To achieve this we are going to optimize code so that bulk inserts can happen by parallelizing it
Andy will upload the new Files, we need to identify the issues, table details, columns, etc.. like Characteristic tables 
Tasks:
Initial analysis on Staging Glue Job code  
Code changes in staging glue job  for bulk inserts
Sample Data Preparation.
Test staging  job by taking source file with 10k records. We are not expecting an AP file with more than 10k records
Deploy code to DEV and UAT so that we can release this on 10th-Oct-2025 to Prod.
Note: This may be delayed if any issue is identified in Prod.
Acceptance Criteria:
Database transaction should be able to commit within 15mins in staging glue job if a file having 10k records is processed.
*************************************************************
Got it! Here's a reworded version with a fresh angle so it feels distinct but covers your responsibilities clearly:

---

As part of ensuring scalability and performance, we need to verify that each database transaction completes within the 15-minute IAM authentication window. To support larger data volumes, the staging Glue job will be enhanced to process bulk inserts more efficiently through parallel execution.

Andy will continue uploading new PFD files. My focus will be on troubleshooting any processing issues in the staging Glue job related to these files, including verifying table mappings and column integrity.

**Tasks:**

1. Review and resolve defects in the staging Glue job pipeline related to new PFD source file ingestion.
2. Refactor the Glue job code to improve bulk insert throughput by enabling parallel database writes.
3. Conduct tests using sample datasets (up to 10k records) and coordinate deployment to DEV and UAT for further validation.

---

Would you like a version with a slightly more technical or project-management tone?




ac:
The staging Glue job successfully processes new PFD source files without errors.

Database transactions commit within 15 minutes when processing files containing up to 10,000 records.

Bulk insert operations leverage parallelism to optimize performance and prevent job failures due to connection timeouts.

Code changes are successfully deployed and validated in DEV and UAT environments before production release.

Today i hv to provide kt on staging 

basically our source is pfd (payment file diagnostic) ,they provide source which will have spend data

like lets say we have buyer 'a' wat all transactions done by A with its suppliers

we get source file with following columns 
sample source data (pfd)
which existing landing schema of postgress
