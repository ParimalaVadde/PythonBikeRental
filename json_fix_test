jira story : SDS Data Processing : Test upload functionality in staging

Deploy fixed code to UAT and perform functional testing of staging job for all tables in staging

Fix identified staging job issues and make the data pipeline operational for PFD.

 

Building the Relationship for Supplier ECID: Establish and validate the relationship between suppliers and their ECIDs to ensure accurate data mapping.
Testing Special Characters: Verify that the system correctly handles special characters in data fields to prevent processing errors.
Handling Empty Strings: Implement logic to appropriately manage empty strings in data inputs, ensuring they don't cause pipeline failures.

Execute and validate the upload process end‑to‑end. Identify any errors or failures and implement fixes to ensure reliable data ingestion.


sub task 2: Validate Special Character and Empty String Handling
Test and refine the staging logic to handle special characters and empty strings in incoming data without pipeline failures.

Sub-task 1: Test Upload Functionality & Resolve Issues
Upload process tested end-to-end with issues resolved for seamless data ingestion.

Sub-task 2: Validate Special Character and Empty String Handling
Special characters and empty strings handling validated to maintain pipeline stability.

All upload functionality, staging jobs, and data pipeline issues have been tested and resolved, with supplier-ECID relationships, special character handling, and empty string management validated for reliable and accurate data processing.
