I am planning to visit the USA for three months, around February or March 2025, until June 2025, on a B1/B2 visitor visa. I will be staying at my friend's apartment in California. She graduated from university there and has been working in IT. During my stay, I intend to explore the city and assess whether it would be a suitable place for pursuing higher studies in the future.

I am currently preparing for the IELTS exam, which I will be taking in 20 days. I will be self-sponsoring for my flight tickets, and my accommodation will be covered by my friend.

I am applying for a B1/B2 visa with a 10-year validity, which will allow me to visit the USA for up to 180 days per year during the next decade.

I request that my biometrics and visa appointment be scheduled in Hyderabad, as I reside here. I will not be able to travel to other cities (Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata) for the appointment, as I do not have any support in those locations.
