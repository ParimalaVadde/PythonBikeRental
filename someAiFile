I can see from your output that:

1. The last successful run was on 2023-09-27 (status: applied)
2. There was a canceled run on 2025-04-04 (very recent)
3. The state list shows that you already have two VPC endpoints configured:
   - `module.vpc-endpoint-rds`
   - `module.vpc-endpoint-secrets-manager`

The RDS endpoint module is already in your state, which implies that you shouldn't need to create it - it already exists. However, it appears that recent runs have had issues (either canceled or errored), which suggests there might be problems with the configuration.

Since we can see the state contains the module you're working with, I'd recommend:

1. Try to get the current configuration:
```bash
$ tfl workspace show-configuration
```

If that doesn't work, try downloading the state to examine it:
```bash
$ tfl state pull > terraform.tfstate
```

2. Create a new file that matches your existing configuration but makes your changes:
```bash
$ cat > main.tf << 'EOF'
module "vpc-endpoint-rds" {
  source  = "tfe.jpmchase.net/ATLAS-MODULE-REGISTRY/vpc-endpoint/aws"
  version = "7.0.0"
  
  configuration = {
    service_name = "rds"
    subnet_type  = "Private"
  }
}

module "vpc-endpoint-secrets-manager" {
  source  = "tfe.jpmchase.net/ATLAS-MODULE-REGISTRY/vpc-endpoint/aws"
  version = "7.0.0"
  
  configuration = {
    service_name = "secretsmanager"
    subnet_type  = "Private"
  }
}
EOF
```

3. If you need to make changes to the existing configuration, you might want to examine the most recent logs to understand why the run was canceled or errored:
```bash
$ tfl run show run-q7zTyxYY7TJREi4F
```

What specific changes are you trying to make to the VPC endpoints? Are you trying to add a new one, modify existing ones, or remove one?
