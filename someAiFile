Here's a simple breakdown of the commands you'll need to execute for setting up the EaC (Environment as Code):

### 1. **Install EaC CLI**
If you're using **Dev Shell**:
- Install the EaC CLI with the command:
  ```bash
  ds tool install eac-cli
  ```

- To verify it's installed, run:
  ```bash
  eac
  ```

### 2. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS CODE)**

- Install VS CODE from the official site: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Make sure to add the **YAML Extension by Redhat** in VS CODE for autocompletion with EaC configuration files.

### 3. **Request Access**
- To request access for your SID, run:
  ```bash
  eac access request
  ```

### 4. **Register SID/FID**
- Register your SID or FID to EaC using this command:
  ```bash
  eac user register -d <DOMAIN> -u <SID>
  ```
  For example:
  ```bash
  eac user register -d NAEAST -u N652959
  ```

### 5. **Show EaC Configuration**
- To see the current configuration, run:
  ```bash
  eac config show
  ```

### 6. **Configure EaC CLI**
- Fetch the latest modulepack version:
  ```bash
  eac modulepack list
  ```
  
- Set your configuration values:
  ```bash
  eac config set -c "<REPLACE_JIRA_ID> Deploying Infra with EaC"
  eac config set -v "<X.X.X> (replace with the version from the previous command)"
  eac config set -r ssh://git@<REPLACE_BITBUCKET_CLUSTER>:7999/<REPLACE_PROJECT_NAME>/<REPLACE_REPO_NAME>.git
  eac config set -f develop
  eac config set -b feature/eac-setup-tech-primer
  ```

Once you run these steps, you should be good to go with EaC setup on your local machine!
