I'll create a Jira user story based on the information you provided about the VPC Endpoint module deprecation. Here's a structured user story with a short description and acceptance criteria:

## Short Description
Upgrade VPC Endpoint module to version 7.0.0 to remediate data exfiltration vulnerability in B2B Payables X-Business Supplier Directory Services application (SEAL ID: 111597).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Identify all VPC Endpoints across DEV, TEST, and PROD environments that are using outdated module-vpc-endpoint versions
2. Update Terraform code for all identified VPC endpoints to use version 7.0.0
3. Run Spinnaker/Jules pipeline or TFL plan/apply on each repository
4. Verify successful upgrade by confirming MODULE_VERSION tag shows 7.0.0 in AWS Console for each VPC endpoint
5. Complete verification that all VPC endpoints are functioning as expected after upgrade
6. Complete upgrade before May 15, 2025 to avoid FARM breaks and security vulnerabilities

Would you like me to add any additional details to the user story?
