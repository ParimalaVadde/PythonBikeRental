Hi Parimala

Thanks for this 

1.	client_name is the name of the buyer not the supplier , your mapping is incorrect
2.	map these to payment_profile_attribute_type , append the column name with “scf_” so that we are clear that they are scf attributes 
a.	throughput_usd
b.	avg_spread
c.	avg_payment_terms
d.	rate_proposed
e.	rate_offered
f.	esg_discount
3.	mapping is correct for this , ind_decline , but append the column name with “scf_”
4.	stp_partnershiplist should currently be mapped to payment_profile_attribute_type - product_segmentation_applicable , if yes , no changes , if no then map
