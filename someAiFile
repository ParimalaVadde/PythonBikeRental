Team,
Please find attached the updated FARM findings excel with "New Assignee" column. These FARM findings must be resolved as a top priority.
The assignment logic:

If the same finding exists across DEV, TEST and PROD, I've assigned the same person to handle all environments
Everyone has been assigned 2-3 findings, except those handling the same finding across all 3 environments
I've taken 5 findings under my own responsibility

We will have daily catch up calls for status progress and any blocker discussion from tomorrow.
Please begin analysis and work on your assigned items immediately. If you have any genuine concerns about your assignments, please reach out to me with valid reasons.
Thank you,
