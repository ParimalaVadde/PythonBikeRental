Let's try a different approach since the Windows environment might be handling backslashes differently. Try creating the .terraformignore file with forward slashes instead:

```bash
$ echo ".terraform/modules/**" > .terraformignore
```

If that doesn't work, let's create the file using a text editor:

```bash
$ vim .terraformignore
```

Then in Vim:
1. Press `i` to enter insert mode
2. Type or paste: `.terraform/modules/**`
3. Press Esc
4. Type `:wq` and press Enter

Alternatively, try both versions in the same file:

```bash
$ echo -e ".terraform/modules/**\n.terraform\\modules\\**" > .terraformignore
```

After creating the file, verify its contents with:

```bash
$ cat .terraformignore
```

And then try running the plan again:

```bash
$ tfl plan
```

If you're still getting the error, there might be a specific format requirement for your environment. You might want to check with colleagues who have successfully set up Terraform in your organization.
