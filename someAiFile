Based on the tfl help output, I see the commands available in your environment. Let's adjust our approach to work with these commands. Here's how you can upgrade the VPC endpoint modules:

1. First, let's pull the configuration from one of the workspaces that needs updating. Based on your data, let's start with the RDS endpoint in the DEV environment:

   ```bash
   $ tfl configure
   Address> https://tfe.jpmchase.net
   Org> 111597-114116-DEV
   Project> Default Project
   Workspace> v812871-vpc-endpoint
   TF Version> 1.0.8-20230519-JPMC
   Region> us-east-1
   ```

2. Once configured, pull the Terraform files:
   ```bash
   $ mkdir -p v812871-vpc-endpoint && cd v812871-vpc-endpoint
   $ tfl get
   ```

3. After pulling the files, search for the VPC endpoint module:
   ```bash
   $ grep -r "module.*vpc-endpoint" .
   ```

4. Edit the files containing VPC endpoint module references. You can use a text editor to change the version from the current version (e.g., "4.11.0") to "7.0.0".

5. After updating the files, validate your changes:
   ```bash
   $ tfl validate
   ```

6. Run a plan to see what will change:
   ```bash
   $ tfl plan
   ```

7. If the plan looks good, apply the changes:
   ```bash
   $ tfl apply
   ```

8. After the apply completes, verify in the AWS console that the MODULE_VERSION tag has been updated to 7.0.0.

9. Repeat steps 1-8 for each workspace in your list.

To automate this process for multiple workspaces, you could create a script that:
1. Takes a CSV file with the workspace information
2. For each workspace, configures tfl, pulls the config, updates the module version, and applies the changes
3. Logs the results

Here's a simple approach for multiple workspaces:

1. Create a file named `workspaces.txt` with the workspace details:
   ```
   111597-114116-DEV,Default Project,v812871-vpc-endpoint
   111597-114116-DEV,Default Project,terraform-lambda-v812871
   111597-114116-DEV,Default Project,xbsd-apigw-setup-ecs
   ```

2. Run a loop to process each workspace:
   ```bash
   while IFS=, read -r org project workspace; do
     echo "Processing $org/$project/$workspace"
     
     # Configure tfl
     tfl configure <<EOF
   https://tfe.jpmchase.net
   $org
   $project
   $workspace
   1.0.8-20230519-JPMC
   us-east-1
   EOF
     
     # Create directory and pull files
     mkdir -p "$workspace" && cd "$workspace"
     tfl get
     
     # Find and update VPC endpoint modules
     files=$(grep -l "module.*vpc-endpoint" *.tf 2>/dev/null)
     for file in $files; do
       sed -i 's/version = "[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+"/version = "7.0.0"/g' "$file"
       echo "Updated $file"
     done
     
     # Validate, plan, and apply
     tfl validate
     tfl plan
     # Uncomment the following line when you're ready to apply
     # tfl apply -auto-approve
     
     cd ..
     echo "Completed $workspace"
     echo "-----------------------"
   done < workspaces.txt
   ```

Note that this script includes `-auto-approve` for tfl apply, which would automatically approve the changes without manual confirmation. Remove that flag if you want to review each apply operation before confirming.

Would you like me to adjust any part of this approach to better fit your environment or needs?
