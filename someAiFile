Install VS CODE
We would like you to install and configure Visual Studio Code if you have not already done so. You will also have to install the plugin YAML Extension by Redhat to be able to use EaC's yaml auto-completion features. Please refer to this page for installation and configuration steps.
Autocompleting on VS CODE
EaC provides the ability to auto populate the configuration Yaml files. It is important that you use VS CODE with the Yaml Extension (and not Intellij or any other IDE) to work with the EaC configuration files.

EaC generates the schema for the configuration files (both model and deployment files) that is automatically added to the top of the yaml files generated by the EaC CLI.
To begin populating the fields, use CTRL+SPACE to select a value among the available options
If there are yaml validation errors, because the YAML file defined by you does not match the schema generated, you will see a red squiggly line to highlight the error.
Note: You should see red squigglies upon opening the file for the first time, if you do not see any squigglies, double check to ensure you have enabled the YAML Extension by Redhat plugin.

Request EaC Access
The EaC team provides users with the ability to request access to the EaC CLI via RSAM request.
Ensure you've downloaded the EaC CLI based on your platform of choice (as mentioned above).
Execute the following command to enable EaC to request access for your SID on your behalf. An RSAM Request ID will be generated please have your RSAM approved prior to generating a Runtime Model.
eac access request
Request Example
Example for single SID request for EaC


Register SID/FID to EaC
Execute the following command to enable EaC to register your SID or FID to our system.

Note
This will have to be done every time a user obtains access to a new AWS Account or Role. Refer here for details on AWS accounts and roles.
Execute the following command to register your SID to EaC.
eac user register -d <DOMAIN> -u <SID>

Example:
$ eac user register -d NAEAST -u N652959

status: SUCCESS
state: STATE_USER_REGISTER
code: 200
message: User is registered
Show EaC Configuration
EaC provides a simplified way of managing configuration directly through the EaC CLI. You can view the current configuration by executing the following command:

eac config show

Configure EaC CLI
Run the following command to set your EaC Config, additional info on this command can be found here.
We will need to fetch the latest modulepack version for our configuration. Run the command below and look up the latest available modulepack version.

eac modulepack list
Sample Output
Sample output for modulepack list

eac config set -c "<REPLACE_JIRA_ID> Deploying Infra with EaC"
eac config set -v "<X.X.X> (Replace with Latest Version listed in previous command)"
eac config set -r ssh://git@<REPLACE_BITBUCKET_CLUSTER>:7999/<REPLACE_PROJECT_NAME>/<REPLACE_REPO_NAME>.git
eac config set -f develop
eac config set -b feature/eac-setup-tech-primer
Note
It is important to set these values because in the next steps these values will be used to populate the values needed by Jules to build your AWS environment.
