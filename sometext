Steps for Raising SNOW Change Request.

Before raising the change request make sure to create run notebook and capture test evidence of lower env.

1. Locate the previous successful change request (CHG35514839)

2. Open the previous change request in ServiceNow

3. Click on "Copy Change" to create a new change request based on the previous one

4. Update the following fields:
    note : short description and description should start with the phrase "CommercialCard Client-Impact=N <APP-NOT-LIVE> - B2B Supplier Directory Services (111597) - "
      once app goes live in production then update client-Impact and APP-LIVE accordingly.

sample Short Description and Description format: 
   - Short Description: "CommercialCard Client-Impact=N <APP-NOT-LIVE> - B2B Supplier Directory Services (111597) - Upgrade VPC Endpoints via Spinnaker to AWS Production environment"

description should be in below format only
   - Description: CommercialCard Client-Impact=N <APP-NOT-LIVE> - B2B Supplier Directory Services (111597) - Upgrade VPC Endpoints via Spinnaker to AWS Production environment 

Impacted Platform: XBSD SEAL ID: 111597
Impacted Application - B2B Payables X-Business Supplier Directory Services

What is the change doing: This change is upgrading 11 VPC endpoints in Production environment to latest versions

Why is the change needed: To ensure all VPC endpoints are running on current versions as part of infrastructure maintenance and compliance

Impacts to downstream applications(Blast Radius): No impact as this is infrastructure upgrade with no functional changes to application flows

Impact to users(Blast Radius): No user impact as the application is not live yet and the upgrades will maintain the same functionality

Worst case scenario if the change goes bad: VPC connectivity issues that could affect AWS service access from the VPC

How do we react and adjust to protect against worst case scenario: We will execute rollback by restoring the previous Terraform workspace state and revert to the prior endpoint configuration

5. Set "Release Attestation" field to "Yes" as it involves code-related changes(either infra or functional related)

6. Review all other fields from the previous change request and update as needed

7. Create the following change tasks:
   - Task 1: UTA Sign-off 
   - Task 2: Pre-implementation validation (optional)
   - Task 3: Implementation (2 implementation tasks for CCTOPS)
   - Task 4: Post-implementation validation
   - (Refer to previous change tasks for proper format and assignment)

8. After creating the change request get it reviewed.

9. After completing all the above steps, click on "Access" then "Request Authorize" to submit the change request for approval

CCTOPS dl : is_pradeep_shukla@restricted.chase.com, Commercial Card Prod Support Tech 

10. after creating change request set up call with CCTOPS implementation team (CCTOPS dl : is_pradeep_shukla@restricted.chase.com, Commercial Card Prod Support Tech ), get the run book reviewed from the team.

11. on implemenation day . wat ever execution completed in lower env (i.e dev and test ) need to be pushed to prod

steps to be followed

a) create feature branch which needs to be merged with master.
b) Clone the feature branch:
   
i) `git clone -b <feature_branch_name> <ssh link>`

ii) git switch <feature branch name>"

open vs code

Execute these commands in terminal:
   a) `eac model validate -f <model_file_name>`
   b) `eac model apply -f <model_file_name>`
   c) `eac deployment plan -f <deployment_file_name>`
   d) `eac deployment preflight -f <deployment_file_name>`
   e) `eac config set -b <feature_branch_name>`
   f) `eac config set -r "ssh://git@bitbucketdc-ssh.jpmchase.net:7999/xbsd/xbsd-base.git"`
   g) `eac config set -c <get the commit msg from dev team>`
   h) `eac config set -p <feature_branch_name>`
   i) `eac config set -f <feature_branch_name>`
   j) `eac deployment pipeline init -f <deployment_file_name>`
   h) `eac deployment apply -f <deployment_file_name>`

after running apply cmd it asks for lower env deployment file name and lower env spinnaker pipeline name , provide the test env deployment file name and test env spinnaker pipeline name

then build will be triggered in test env spinnaker pipeline, build will be triggered for test env first

The build link can be obtained from below link

"https://spinnaker.prod.aws.jpmchase.net/#/applications/111597_xbsd-base/executions"  - to view the status of deployment - 

1. Login into the spinnaker using your SID and credentials
2. Monitor the spinnaker build to ensure its completion and provide inputs on test validation completion for build to proceed further whenever requested.


After successful completion of build for test env in spinnaker UI

then a jetid gets created in JET UI

Click on quality tab and select the test , and upload the edvidence

then go to continuous delivery and click on promote

after click on promote, it go to review. which rohit has authrize and approve this review

only then change goes to implement state

then deploy in prod env in spinnaker either manually triggering the pipeline or by running the cmds
