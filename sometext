Hi Gustavo,

Thank you for providing the guidance links on how to enable awsback to AWS-RDS-DBCluster.

I wanted to update you on the progress of enabling AWS backups for the AWS-RDS-DBCluster. We have followed the required steps as outlined below:
 
1. Tag Addition: Added the tag `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP`.
2. Immutable Backups: Set the `enable_immutable_backups` parameter to true.
 
However, after implementing these changes, we are not seeing the data backed up in the AWS Backup console (core-immutable).

According to the documentation, the required Terraform version for this setup is 11.0.0. The issue we are facing is that we are using EAC, and the equivalent EAC version for 11.0.0 is currently unknown to us.
 
We are currently on EAC module pack version 0.10.0. When attempting to upgrade to a later version (post 0.10.0), we encounter the following error related to the tag `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP`:

```
on variables.tf line 581:
41│ 581: variable "tags" {
42│ ├────────────────
43│ │ var.tags is map of string with 3 elements
44│
45│ CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION is a reserved tag used by the Data Protection team to enable/disable backups. Users are prohibited from using this tag.
46│
47│ This was checked by the validation rule at variables.tf:585,3-13.
48╵
50 Operation failed: failed running terraform plan (exit 1)
```


This error indicates that the higher version does not allow users to add the `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP` tag, which is essential for backup functionality.



We’ve raised a support ticket (CCBEAASSD-3399) with the EAC team to clarify the required version and how to proceed. 

In the meantime, with the 30th Jan being the deadline for this task and the need to deploy to production, I require your thoughts on how we should move forward.
