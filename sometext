Certainly! Here's a polished business-style message with **clear examples of data incompleteness** for each affected JSON column, using actual cutoff examples from your data:

### 📢 **Subject**: Data Incompleteness Identified in Latest Files from PFD Source Team

Dear \[Team/Stakeholders],

We have begun reviewing the latest dataset received from the PFD source team. During the validation process, we observed that several JSON columns contain **incomplete or truncated data**. These issues may affect data reliability and downstream processing.

### ⚠️ **Impacted JSON Columns & Sample Issues**

Below is a list of impacted columns, along with representative examples of the incompleteness observed:

---

#### 1. **`registered_agents`**

* **Expected**: Full list of registered agent names or entities.
* **Incomplete Example**:

  ```
  ['C T CORPORATION SYSTEM', '825 8TH AVENUE']
  ```

  > Only partial address or entity name provided, with missing contextual details.

---

#### 2. **`associated_people`**

* **Expected**: Complete records including `name` and `titles`.
* **Incomplete Example**:

  ```json
  [{'name': 'JOEL DAVID CHESTERMAN', 'titles': ['SECRETARY', 'CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER']}, {'name': 'CH...
  ```

  > The second person's name appears truncated (`'CH...`), and the full record is cut off.

---

#### 3. **`industries`**

* **Expected**: Full industry classification including both `classification_type` and `description`.
* **Incomplete Example**:

  ```json
  {'classification_description': 'corporate office', 'classification_type': 'enigma_description'}
  ```

  > Some entries appear fine, but others are missing one or both expected keys.

---

#### 4. **`corporate_structures`**

* **Expected**: Entity type with consistent formatting (e.g., LLC, Corporation).
* **Incomplete Example**:

  ```
  LLC
  ```

  > While not invalid, certain rows only include entity types without related structure information or links to other fields.

---

#### 5. **`eins`**

* **Expected**: Full EIN values (Employer Identification Numbers).
* **Incomplete Example**:

  ```
  [Blank or missing in many rows]
  ```

  > Several entries are either missing or entirely null.

---

#### 6. **`technologies_used`**

* **Expected**: List of technologies used with fields like `vendor_name`, `category`, etc.
* **Incomplete Example**:

  ```json
  {'vendor_name': 'Shopify', 'category': 'payments'}
  ```

  > Appears correct, but other rows are missing this field or only partially populated.

---

#### 7. **`has_online_payments`**

* **Expected**: Boolean or flag indicating online payment capability.
* **Incomplete Example**:

  ```
  [Blank in several entries]
  ```

  > Not consistently populated across rows.

---

#### 8. **`card_revenue`**

* **Expected**: Detailed revenue data with date ranges and nested structures.
* **Incomplete Example**:

  ```json
  {'end_date': '2025-03-31', 'date_accessible': '2025-06-15', '1m': {'start_date': '2025-03-01', 'aver...
  ```

  > Data appears cut off at `"aver..."`, likely intended to be `"average"` or another metric field.

---

#### 9. **`card_transactions_stability`**

* **Expected**: Similar structure to `card_revenue` with metrics over time.
* **Incomplete Example**:

  ```json
  {'end_date': '2025-03-31', 'date_accessible': '2025-06-15', '1m': {'start_date': '2025-03-01', 'days...
  ```

  > JSON is cut off mid-field, indicating potential serialization or truncation issues.

### ✅ **Next Steps**

We recommend the following actions:

1. **Engage with the PFD source team** to confirm if this data is final or if updated files are expected.
2. **Request re-delivery** of the affected fields with complete records.
3. **Delay downstream processing** until clean, complete data is available (to avoid misreporting or partial ingestion).

Please let us know how you'd like to proceed, or if you'd prefer us to raise this directly with the source team.

Best regards,
