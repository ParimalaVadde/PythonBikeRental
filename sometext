Yes, it's okay to execute the commands in the path **`I:\ds\xbsd-aurora-postgresql`** as long as this is the root directory of your Git repository and where the repository has been cloned locally.

Here’s why:
- The Git repository is located in this directory (`I:\ds\xbsd-aurora-postgresql`), so any Git-related commands (like creating a new branch or committing changes) will apply to the files in this repository.
- The `eac deployment apply` command and other EaC-related commands will also work within this directory, as long as you have the correct `aurora-Infra_Deploy_Test.yaml` deployment file and your repository is set up correctly.

### To summarize, follow these steps in the current directory:

1. **Create and switch to a new branch**:
   Run these commands to create a new branch from `release/aurora20` (or the branch you're working from):
   ```bash
   git checkout release/aurora20  # Make sure you're on the latest release/aurora20 branch
   git pull origin release/aurora20  # Ensure the branch is up-to-date
   git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name  # Create a new branch
   ```

2. **Make your changes** (e.g., modify `aurora-Infra_Deploy_Test.yaml`).

3. **Stage, commit, and push the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add aurora-Infra_Deploy_Test.yaml  # Stage the file you changed
   git commit -m "<XBSD-898> Deploying Infra with EaC, Enabling AWS Backups tool for rds aurora postgress"  # Commit the changes
   git push origin feature/your-branch-name  # Push the new branch to the remote repo
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** on Bitbucket from `feature/your-branch-name` to `release/aurora20`.

Once the PR is approved and merged, the changes will be applied to the `release/aurora20` branch as part of the deployment.

### Conclusion:
Yes, it’s fine to execute these commands in the **`I:\ds\xbsd-aurora-postgresql`** directory as long as it’s your local Git repository, and the necessary files (like the `aurora-Infra_Deploy_Test.yaml`) are located there.
