Enable AWS Backups for AWS-RDS-DBCluster
To enable  backups for the storage resources, need to follow below steps:

1) Need to add the following tag, CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION : PITR BACKUP -- added

2) Next we need to set the enable_immutable_backups parameter to true  -- set flag to true

3) Required terraform version

Resource/Storage	Terraform version
rds-postgres	11.0.0

Following up with EAC team to know the required eac version to enable back for rds

For enabling AWS backups for RDS:
 
Added the required tag: CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP.
Set the enable_immutable_backups variable to true.
After enabling above 2 changes. we dont see data is getting backed up in aws backup console(core-immutable)
The Terraform version required, as per documentation, is 11.0.0.
The equivalent EAC version for 11.0.0 is not known; following up with the EAC team for clarification.
We require your assistance to understand if any other additional changes required

and also
currently we are using eac modulepack version: 0.10.0

when we tried to upgrade to later version ,the later version post 10 are not allowing to add tag CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP

getting following error:
