The email you've written is clear and communicates the issue well, but there are a few tweaks for readability and clarity. Here's a slightly refined version:

**Subject:** Assistance Required with Enabling AWS Backups for RDS DBCluster

Hi EAC Team,

We are in the process of enabling AWS backups for our AWS-RDS-DBCluster and have followed the steps outlined below:

1. **Tag Addition**: Added the tag `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP`.
2. **Immutable Backups**: Set the `enable_immutable_backups` parameter to true.

After implementing these changes, we are not seeing the data being backed up in the AWS Backup console (core-immutable).

As per the documentation, the required Terraform version for this setup is 11.0.0. However, we are using EAC, and we are unsure of the equivalent EAC version for 11.0.0. Could you please confirm the necessary EAC version?

Additionally, when we attempt to upgrade our EAC module pack to a version later than 0.10.0, we encounter the following error related to the tag `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP`:

```
on variables.tf line 581:
41│ 581: variable "tags" {
42│ ├────────────────

```

We would appreciate your guidance on resolving this matter and any additional steps we need to take to properly enable backups.

**Key adjustments made:**
1. **Subject line added**: It helps provide context for the reader immediately.
2. **Sentence structure adjustments**: Made small changes to improve readability, such as breaking up some longer sentences for easier comprehension.
3. **Clarified the tag issue**: Reworded the explanation to make it a little clearer.
4. **Consistent formatting**: Ensured the issue with the Terraform error was presented in a more uniform way.

I hope this helps! Does this version work for you?
