i need to create user story for below give me description and acceptance criteria

UAT testing-fixing issues  for the Staging data load



for ur reference earlier user story
SDS Data Processing : Process New PFD source file & integrate additional fields into pipeline

Description
Ingest the newly shared PFD source file and enhance the SDS data pipeline to integrate additional fields. Update mapping logic, apply necessary schema changes, and ensure end-to-end data flow for new attributes is validated and functional. Address any format discrepancies or structural changes in the new file.


Acceptance Criteria:

New PFD source file successfully ingested into staging.
All new fields correctly integrated across relevant tables.
Schema and mapping files updated to reflect new additions.
Data format discrepancies (if any) identified and handled.
Validation completed using sample/test data.
No regression in existing pipeline functionality.


Based on your reference, here's a user story for UAT testing and fixing issues for the Staging data load:

## User Story
**UAT Testing - Staging Data Load Issue Resolution**

### Description
Conduct comprehensive User Acceptance Testing (UAT) on the staging environment data load processes and resolve any identified issues to ensure data quality, integrity, and pipeline stability. This includes validating the recently integrated PFD source file changes, verifying data transformations, and addressing any defects or inconsistencies discovered during testing phase.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Test Execution Completed**
   - All UAT test cases executed against staging data load processes
   - Test results documented with detailed findings and evidence

2. **Issue Identification & Documentation**
   - All data quality issues, pipeline failures, or discrepancies identified and logged
   - Root cause analysis completed for each identified issue
   - Issues prioritized based on severity and business impact

3. **Defect Resolution**
   - Critical and high-priority issues resolved and deployed to staging
   - Data mapping corrections applied where necessary
   - Schema inconsistencies addressed and validated

4. **Data Validation & Verification**
   - End-to-end data flow verified from source to target tables
   - Data completeness and accuracy validated against expected results
   - Business rules and transformation logic confirmed working correctly

5. **Regression Testing**
   - Existing functionality verified to ensure no new issues introduced
   - Previously working data loads confirmed still operational
   - Performance benchmarks maintained or improved

6. **Sign-off & Documentation**
   - UAT test summary report prepared with all results
   - Updated documentation reflecting any changes made during issue resolution
   - Business stakeholder sign-off obtained for staging environment readiness

Here's a simplified version focused on manual testing with Excel documentation:

## User Story
**UAT Testing - Staging Data Load Issue Resolution**

### Description
Conduct manual User Acceptance Testing (UAT) on the staging environment data load processes and fix any identified issues. Test the PySpark Glue job functionality and document all findings in Excel format.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Manual Testing Completed**
   - All test scenarios executed manually on staging environment
   - Excel test documentation created with test results

2. **Issues Identified & Fixed**
   - Data load issues identified and documented in Excel tracker
   - All critical issues resolved in the PySpark Glue job

3. **Data Validation Passed**
   - Source to target data mapping verified manually
   - Data quality checks completed with expected results

4. **Documentation Updated**
   - Excel test summary completed with pass/fail status
   - Issue resolution log maintained in Excel format

5. **Staging Environment Ready**
   - All identified issues resolved and validated
   - Staging data load process working as expected
