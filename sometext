in below function i need to make changes


mapping_file_path="s3://app-id-111597-dep-id-114116-uu-id-9x0jt94siuto/pfd/mapping/pfd_mapping.csv"

def process_mapping_and_transform_data(source_df, mapping_file_path, output_data_path):
    """
    Reads a mapping file and input data, applies column transformations, and writes the transformed data to S3.
    """
    # Read the mapping file into a Glue DynamicFrame
    mapping_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
        connection_type="s3",
        connection_options={"paths": [mapping_file_path]},
        format="csv",
        format_options={"withHeader": True}
    ).toDF()

    print("Reading mapping file completed")
	
	

currently we are reading csv file which is in specific s3 paths
but now this shouldn't be the case


means i need to import csv file in python file
like it the csv file "pfd_mapping.csv" will be in same path as that of python file 

in that case what chnages to be done. will below changes work???

mapping_file_path = "pfd_mapping.csv"

def process_mapping_and_transform_data(source_df, mapping_file_path, output_data_path):
    """
    Reads a mapping file and input data, applies column transformations, and writes the transformed data to S3.
    """
    # Read the mapping file into a Glue DynamicFrame
    mapping_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
        connection_type="s3",
        connection_options={"paths": [mapping_file_path]},
        format="csv",
        format_options={"withHeader": True}
    ).toDF()

    print("Reading mapping file completed")
