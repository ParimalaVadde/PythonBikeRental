1. Update the mapping configuration to include relevant new PFD fields
2. Ensure existing mappings that are changing are correctly updated
3. Handle any unmapped fields appropriately (either map to new targets or mark as not required)
4. Document all mapping changes for reference SDS Data Processing: Supplier Identity and previously performed spend analysis extract to PFD



As a data engineer, I need to update the mapping between the analysis_pfd source system and to SDS staging tables to accommodate new fields and mapping changes, so that we can ensure all relevant data is properly loaded into our data model.

sub task 1
Review the updated analysis_pfd source system documentation to identify new fields and changes to existing fields. Document the data types, formats, and business meaning of each field.

sub task 2
Review the existing staging table structures to determine if they can accommodate new fields. Identify any schema changes needed in the staging tables.

sub task 3
Update the mapping configuration file to include required new field mappings and changes to existing mappings. Include any required transformations or constants.


Apologies for the confusion earlier! Here's an update to the Jira story in the format you're looking for:

**Jira Story:**
*SOS: Updated mapping configuration to include new fields from the `analysis_pfd` source system and adjusted existing mappings. All changes have been documented for reference and data processing.*

---

**Sub-task 1:**
*Completed: Reviewed the updated `analysis_pfd` source system documentation and identified new and changed fields. Documented data types, formats, and business meanings for each field.*

**Sub-task 2:**
*Completed: Reviewed the existing staging table structures. Identified the required schema changes to accommodate the new fields and ensured the structure supports the updated data model.*

**Sub-task 3:**
*Completed: Updated the mapping configuration file to include the new fields and modifications to existing mappings, including necessary transformations and constants. Ensured all relevant fields are properly mapped.*

Let me know if you'd like to make any further adjustments!
