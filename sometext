Hi Mohammed,

In the earlier version of the analysis_pfd source file, the column names were technology and corp_structure.
In the latest file you shared, the column names have changed to technology_used and corporate_structure.

It looks like there have been some naming changes between the v1 file and the latest version for a few columns.

Can we consider the column names in the latest file as final?
