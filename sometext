How can the individual(s) completing the work confirm that they have properly completed this work?

Verification : go/V12 can be searched by ARN to show the “CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION” tag value for that asset. When there is a valid value for that resource in that tag, that asset has been remediated. The tag should have one of the valid values: Storage Devices 35DAYS,70DAYS,100DAYS,400DAYS,NOBACKUP,PITR_35DAYS  / Database Services=PITR BACKUP,SNAPBACKUP,NOBACKUP,PITRANDSNAPBKP. Once this is done, the backup information will be available in Brews.



so currently for s3 bucket "app-id-111597-dep-id-114116-uu-id-xjc1jpz9pvhv" i see backup is been setup. where data is geetting backed up in aws backup valut (core-immutable) with back up plan of "core-backups-35"

So my question is if add "CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION" as 35DAYS for postgress RDS , will the job be done as mentioned in verification part of user story

or eac(terraform) deployment file do we have actually make modification to take backup in in aws backup valut (core-immutable) with back up plan of CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION to PITR BACKUP



we are using eac instead of terraform. currently i see version as version: 0.9.2 in eac do we have upgrade it to 11.0.0


only by adding tag to rdspostgress resource CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION : "PITR BACKUP" will it meet the requirement?
