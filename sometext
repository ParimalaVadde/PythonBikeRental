Hereâ€™s a more refined version of your questions:

---

I have the following questions:

1) We are using EAC instead of Terraform for deployment. Currently, the version is "9.0.0". Do we need to upgrade to "11.0.0"?

2) If I add the tag "CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP" to the PostgreSQL RDS, will that satisfy the verification requirement?
