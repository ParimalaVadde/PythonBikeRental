Thanks for the context! For a banking project with suppliers being onboarded, here are 10 **two-word** values for the **sds notes** column that could fit supplier-related notes:

1. Approved vendor
2. Risk assessed
3. Compliance verified
4. Contract pending
5. Payment terms
6. Document submitted
7. Background check
8. Credit approved
9. KYC completed
10. Active supplier

Would you like me to add short explanations or expand these?
