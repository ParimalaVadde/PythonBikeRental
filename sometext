SDS AOCOMM - Upgrade VPC Endpoints (11 Prod, 1 Dev) in XBSD Application 	

1. All 11 Production VPC endpoints successfully upgraded to the latest version
2. Access permission issues resolved for the Dev endpoint with AWS administration team assistance
3. Upgrade successfully completed for the 1 Dev endpoint with previous access issues
4. Post-upgrade validation to ensure all endpoints are functioning correctly
5. Documentation updated with details of all upgraded endpoints
6. SNOW Change Request raised and approved for Production environment upgrades
7. All 26 VPC endpoints (100%) upgraded across Test, Dev, and Production environments

As part of our ongoing infrastructure maintenance, we need to upgrade 12 VPC endpoints for the XBSD application. This includes:

11 VPC endpoints in the Production environment.
1 VPC endpoint in the Development environment that has pending access permission issues
This task is part of the full scope of upgrading all 26 VPC endpoints across all environments. The other 14 endpoints (10 in Test, 4 in Dev environments) have already been completed.

For the 1 Dev environment endpoint with access issues, we'll need coordination with the AWS administration team to resolve permission-related blockers before proceeding with the upgrade.
