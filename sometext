**Subject:** AWS Backup Setup for RDS DBCluster – Need Guidance on Next Steps

Hi Rohit,

I wanted to update you on the progress of enabling AWS backups for the AWS-RDS-DBCluster. We’ve followed the required steps as outlined below:

1. **Tag Addition**: Added the tag `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP`.
2. **Immutable Backups**: Set the `enable_immutable_backups` parameter to true.

However, after implementing these changes, we are not seeing the data backed up in the AWS Backup console (core-immutable). According to the documentation, the required Terraform version for this setup is 11.0.0. The challenge we are facing is that we are using EAC, and the equivalent EAC version for 11.0.0 is currently unknown to us.

We are currently on EAC module pack version 0.10.0. When we attempt to upgrade to a later version (post 0.10.0), we encounter the following error related to the tag `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP`:

```
on variables.tf line 581:
41│ 581: variable "tags" {
42│ ├────────────────
43│ │ var.tags is map of string with 3 elements
44│
45│ CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION is a reserved tag used by the Data Protection team to enable/disable backups. Users are prohibited from using this tag.
46│
47│ This was checked by the validation rule at variables.tf:585,3-13.
48╵
50 Operation failed: failed running terraform plan (exit 1)
```

We’ve raised a support ticket with the EAC team to clarify the required version and how to proceed. In the meantime, given that the 25th is the deadline for this task and we also need to deploy it to production, I’d appreciate your suggestion on how we should proceed:

- Should we go ahead and raise a change request to add the tags in the EAC production environment for Postgres, even if the backup isn’t fully functional yet?
- Or should we wait for the EAC team’s response before making any changes?

Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
