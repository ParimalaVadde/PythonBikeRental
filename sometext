Great! Since you have your changes in the **feature branch** locally and you now want to push those changes to the **release branch**, hereâ€™s how you can go about it:

### Steps to Push Your Feature Branch Changes to the Release Branch:

1. **Ensure Your Feature Branch Is Up to Date**:
   Before you push your changes, you want to make sure that your feature branch is up to date with the latest changes from the `release` branch (in case any changes have been made there). 

   First, fetch the latest changes from the remote:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Rebase or Merge Your Feature Branch onto the Release Branch**:
   Now, you have two main options to integrate the latest changes from the `release` branch into your feature branch. You can either **merge** or **rebase**.

   - **Option 1: Rebase** (Recommended for a cleaner history):
     This will replay your feature branch changes on top of the latest `release` branch changes.

     ```bash
     git checkout feature/xbsd-aurora-postgresql-backup
     git rebase origin/release/aurora20
     ```

     Resolve any merge conflicts if necessary, then continue the rebase process by running:

     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```

     Once the rebase is complete, your feature branch will be updated with the latest changes from `release`.

   - **Option 2: Merge** (Alternatively):
     If you prefer merging instead of rebasing, you can switch to the `release` branch and merge your feature branch into it.

     ```bash
     git checkout release/aurora20
     git merge feature/xbsd-aurora-postgresql-backup
     ```

     Again, resolve any merge conflicts, then commit the changes.

3. **Push the Changes to the Remote Release Branch**:
   
   Once your feature branch has been integrated with the latest `release` branch changes, it's time to push it to the remote.

   If you're pushing a **rebase**-updated feature branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/xbsd-aurora-postgresql-backup
   ```

   If you merged the feature branch into the `release` branch locally, push the changes to the `release` branch on the remote:

   ```bash
   git push origin release/aurora20
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   After pushing the changes to the remote `release` branch, go to **Bitbucket** (or your Git hosting platform), and create a **Pull Request (PR)** from the feature branch (`feature/xbsd-aurora-postgresql-backup`) to the `release/aurora20` branch.

---

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Fetch the latest changes** from the remote repository using `git fetch`.
2. **Rebase** (or **merge**) your feature branch onto the `release/aurora20` branch.
3. **Push the feature branch** changes to the remote repository.
4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** from your feature branch to the `release/aurora20` branch.

Once your PR is approved and merged, your changes will be integrated into the `release` branch.
