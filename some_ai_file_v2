### Recommendations:

1. **Consistency:** Maintain consistency with task names (for example, use "Prepare Runbook" instead of just "Runbook").
2. **Clarifications:** In the access section for Subtask 1, it's useful to define who needs which access, ensuring it’s clear for someone following it.
3. **Actionable steps:** Ensure each subtask contains clear, actionable steps that can be followed easily.
