Hi Team,

Since the call was scheduled on short notice and no one was able to join, I am rescheduling it for tomorrow. Please make sure to join.

Iâ€™m setting up the call to discuss the upcoming certificate changes and deployment in the PROD environment, specifically regarding the Dynamic Intermediate Certificate Authorities (ICA).

Looking forward to your participation.
