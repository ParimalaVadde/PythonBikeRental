Hi @Antunez, Gustavo (CIB Tech, ARG),@Chinta, Veerendra (CIB Tech, IND),

The issue to Backup the AWS RDS is not fixed yet.We are still working with EAC support team as we are using the EAC for deployment. 
We will not be able to complete this AO comms by jan 31.
Our application is not critical and no team is actually using our data.
Please let us know how to proceed further.


Thanks,
Ram

Hi @Antunez, Gustavo (CIB Tech, ARG), @Chinta, Veerendra (CIB Tech, IND),

Thank you for providing the guidance links on how to enable AWS Backup for the AWS-RDS-DBCluster.

I wanted to update you on our progress with enabling AWS backups for the AWS-RDS-DBCluster. We have followed the required steps as outlined in the guidance link:

1.	Tag Addition:  Added the tag `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP`.
2.	Immutable Backups: Set the `enable_immutable_backups` parameter to true.

 

However, despite implementing these changes, we are unable to see the data backed up in the AWS Backup console (core-immutable).

The documentation states that the required Terraform version for this setup is 11.0.0. The issue we’re encountering is that we are using EAC, and the equivalent EAC version for 11.0.0 is currently unknown to us. We are on EAC module pack version 0.10.0, and when attempting to upgrade to a later version (post 0.10.0), we receive the following error related to the `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP` tag:

 

This error indicates that the higher version of EAC does not allow users to add the `CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION: PITR BACKUP` tag, which is essential for backup functionality.

We’ve raised a support ticket (CCBEAASSD-3399) with the EAC team to clarify the required version and how we should proceed.

With the January 30th deadline approaching and the need to deploy to production, we are currently blocked. Could you please advise on the next steps, or let us know if there are any alternatives we should consider?
We want to ensure that this task is completed on time, but the current roadblock might cause a spillover.

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to your advice.

Best regards,
Parimala VR

Hi Parimala,
CIB has identified risk associated with applications that moved to production on AWS and not having immutable backups enabled or documented backup waivers. These AWS resources are flagged as NOT being backed up. The remediation is to upgrade to the recommended minimum terraform version modules to enable backups into centralized immutable vault using strategic AWS Backup Service allowing centralized monitoring & governance.
Please reach out to myself/Veerendra Chinta/ Abdul Pathan If you need any help. 
Risk:
-	Failure to provide proper backups in production could lead to a disruption to business processes that rely on such data (and potential economic, regulatory or reputational loss).  
-	Core Issue associated to this finding has been raised and remediation need to be done by 31/Jan/2025 
-	
Help Guide:
-	How to use AWS Backups Service using tags? Here
-	How to enable AWS Backups Service for existing resources? Here
-	go/backupinfo
Action Required:
-	Review your area’s applications for remediation needed. For each non-compliant asset, You must Upgrade Terraform version of the module to the required version to support the “CORE_BACKUPS_RETENTION” tag
-	Once on that version, a valid value must be set for that tag (for example, “35DAYS” for resources that require immutable backups, or “NOBACKUP” for resources that require a backup waiver).
