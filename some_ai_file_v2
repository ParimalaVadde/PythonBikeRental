We have a requirement to enable AWS Backup for RDS Aurora PostgreSQL.  
We have successfully enabled the backup in the DEV environment using an EaC deployment file. However, when attempting to push the changes to the TEST environment, we are encountering a permission-related issue.

**[7:11 PM] V R, Parimala (CIB Tech, IND, Consultant)**  
We do not have admin privileges. Could you please advise on how to proceed?  
Do we need to raise a request to obtain admin access?
