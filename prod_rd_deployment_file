What is the request?
This request is for all the applications using module-vpc-endpoint to create VPC Endpoints within their AWS accounts to upgrade their Terraform code to use version 7.0.0 of module-vpc-endpoint.

 

Stage	Days	Restrictions (Sentinel failures preventing use of the module in the environment)	Warnings	TPC Status
1	0-45 - Dec 30th 2024	None	DEV, TEST, PROD	DIVEST
2	45-90 - Feb 14th 2025	DEV	TEST, PROD	PROHIBITED
3	90-135 - March 30th 2025	DEV, TEST	PROD	PROHIBITED
4	135-180 - May 15th 2025	DEV, TEST, PROD	None	PROHIBITED
 

Why is it needed, what is the driver of the request?
A data exfiltration vulnerability was identified in ALL the versions of module-vpc-endpoint. To remediate the vulnerability we updated the policy in the module-vpc-endpoint to make the data perimeter more secure in version 7.0.0. This is to align with Data Protection Control Objectives TCS-011 & TCS-012.

What is the impact to the LOB Application Teams of not completing this by the requested date?
The Evergreen platform will raise FARM breaks against Terraform configurations using the module version marked as PROHIBIT.

There is potential for data exfiltration vulnerability getting exploited causing a security risk to the firm if these issues are not remediated.

What is the impact to the firm of not completing this by the requested date?
The current IAM policy for the VPC Endpoint has a vulnerability, making it accessible from outside the AWS Organization. This is a data exfiltration vulnerability that can get exploited and potentially result in financial and reputational impact to the firm.

How do I as an application owner, tech lead, product owner etc. complete this work?
To complete this work upgrade the Terraform code that creates the VPC endpoint to version 7.0.0. For example:

1. Assuming the the current VPC endpoint Terraform code is using version x.y.z

module "vpc-endpoint-elasticache" {
 source  = "tfe.jpmchase.net/ATLAS-MODULE-REGISTRY/vpc-endpoint/aws"
 version = "x.y.z"

 configuration = {
   service_name = "elasticache"
   subnet_type  = "Private"
 }
}

Change the version to “7.0.0”

module "vpc-endpoint-elasticache" {
 source  = "tfe.jpmchase.net/ATLAS-MODULE-REGISTRY/vpc-endpoint/aws"
 version = "7.0.0"

 configuration = {
   service_name = "elasticache"
   subnet_type  = "Private"
 }
}

2. Run the Spinnaker/Jules pipeline on the repo or if using tfl, run tfl plan and then tfl apply.
3. Since this is a breaking change, this will impact the VPC endpoint configuration so this should be completed during planned downtime

4. Verify that VPC endpoint is functioning as expected.

 

The details of the impacted SEAL IDs and vpc endpoints is available on splunk dashboard. If you do not have access to the dashboard, please submit Splunk access request for AWS Config logs. AWS Config logs (available in Splunk index configlogs_aws_audit) are not regarded as sensitive and access for all SEALs can be requested via the atlas_laas_config_power  group in RSAM:

 

Select a Request Item :   Line of Business Application
What line of business application you would like to request:   Atlas Logging
Select an environment/instance for this application:  Production - Atlas Logs - NADC
What action would you like to take:   Add
Select the access you want to request:   atlas_laas_config_power
 

How can the individual(s) completing the work confirm that they have properly completed this work?
1. Go to AWS Console
2. Go to VPC --> Endpoints --> click on the VPC endpoint that was updated --> Tags -- > MODULE_VERSION should be 7.0.0
